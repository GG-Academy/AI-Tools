The main advantage is that you are continuously assisted by a trainer, who explains how certain concepts work, you write code with him, unblocks you when you have errors.
I believe that it is not enough to just do the courses and it is important that you understand the principles that are presented to you in detail through individual study, from one session to another, in this way you can keep up with new concepts!
Good luck to all future programmers!",no,ro,"Am absolvit cursurile academiei în februarie 2023. Sunt mulțumit de raportul dintre calitatea informațiilor și preț.
Avantajul principal este faptul ca ești asistat în continuu de trainer, care îți explica  cum functioneaza anumite concepte, scrii cod cu el, te deblochează când ai erori .
Consider ca nu este suficient doar sa faci cursurile și este important ca principiile care îți sunt prezentate sa le înțelegi în detaliu prin studiu individual, de la o ședință la alta, în acest fel putând sa ții pasul cu noile concepte!

After I contacted someone from them and told me about the course, I was delighted and even happy that the next day a group was already starting and I quickly signed the contract, so that the next day we could start. On the phone, the sales guy told me about their experience in organizing courses, the experience of the trainers (over 10 years of experience), the very high employment rate after completing the course...etc. Therefore, that evening I received the contract, signed it and paid the first installment. In the first module, the first trainer had 1 year or so of experience testing Oppo phones. With all due respect to the girl, but she didn't have enough experience for herself but to teach others. I thought it was an introductory module and they would recover after that, but I was wrong, all the trainers were pretty much the same, little experience, the same information... Therefore, I decided to withdraw, but I found out that there is a clause in the contract that does not allow you to withdraw and you have to pay the full course if you want to do that (I admit, it is also my fault that I did not read that clause in the contract, but I believe that when all the facilities of the course were presented, this clause was intentionally omitted).",no,ro,"Am avut o experienta foarte urâta cu ei.

La telefon tipul de la vânzări mi a povestit de experienta lor in organizarea de cursuri, de experienta formatorilor( peste 10 ani experienta), de rata foarte mare de angajare dupa finalizarea cursului….etc. Prin urmare in seara respectiva am primit contractul, am semnat si am platit prima rata. La primul modul, primul foarmator avea experienta de 1 an si ceva pe testare telefoane opo. Cu tot respectul pentru tipa, dar nu avea suficientă experienta pentru ea dar sa mai predea si altora. Am crezut ca este un modul introductiv si dupa își vor reveni, dar m am înșelat toti formatorii erau cam la fel, experienta putina, informații la fel… Prin urmare am hoatarat sa ma retrag, dar am aflat ca in contract este o clauza care nu ti permite sa te retragi si trebuie sa achiți cursul integral daca vrei sa faci asta (recunosc, este si vina mea ca nu am citit acea clauza din contract, dar consider ca atunci cand au fost prezentate toate facilitățile cursului acesta clauza a fost omisa intenționat).",ro,"4 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101941626910154013053?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSdjUyRGF3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2cd4257cfbe895ba!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICRv52Daw%7CCgsIn7floQYQyLagQA%7C?hl=en,

Cursul este bine structurat, din punctul de vedere al informației și al etapelor de dezvoltare a unui proiect de UX Design și consider că în ceea ce privește partea teoretică am primit multă informație care m-a ajutat să înțeleg mai bine nevoile utulizatorilor și cum putem veni în  întâmpinarea acestora.
Am avut parte de o bună îndrumare din partea trainer-ilor, care ne-au împărtășit informații utile din experiența proprie, ajutându-ne să ne facem o imagine despre cum se derulează un proiect real.

There were some organizational problems with one of the trainers who kept postponing our classes, but after that we had a different trainer for each module. 2, 3 of them were ok, but the others were not so good at teaching and were not able to combine the theory part with the actual exercises.
I recommend those who want to start such a course for such a long period to quit their jobs or work less because it is quite difficult after 8 hours of work to also attend this course for another 3 hours. I'm just saying that you also need time for individual study.
So if you dedicate yourself, the course is good and people get involved if you ask questions, if you are active, passionate, etc.
However, SDA still has work to do on the organization and communication side.",no,ro,"Am urmat cursul de Data Science în cadrul SDA. Au fost ceva probleme de organizare cu unul dintre traineri care ne tot amâna orele, dar după am avut un trainer diferit la fiecare modul. 2, 3 dintre ei au fost ok, ceilalți însă nu se descurcau așa bine în predare și nu reușeau să îmbine partea de teorie cu partea de exerciții propriu zisă.
Recomand celor care vor să înceapă un astfel de curs pe o perioadă atât de mare să renunțe la job sau să lucreze mai puțin pentru că este destul de greu după 8 ore de muncă să intri și la acest curs pentru încă 3 ore. Numai zic că este nevoie și de timp pentru studiu individual.

During the course, I encountered several impediments in terms of the smooth running of the activity, both from an organizational point of view and from the point of view of the information provided. The course is divided into modules, each of which can have a different trainer, and this was the first impediment. Due to the change of trainers, it was difficult to adapt to each one's teaching style. Some of the trainers are very poorly prepared from a pedagogical point of view. Out of 7-8 trainers, approximately 3 were those from whom I can truly say that I learned, with the rest I try to cover as much of the gaps left by them as possible. The materials presented, as well as those on the learning platform offered by SDA, are, for the most part, outdated.
In the end, I can say that I would not recommend SDA further precisely because of these things. People who are looking for professional retraining try to manage their time as best as possible, and because of the shortcomings presented earlier, SDA is a waste of money. If the trainer is good from a technical and pedagogical point of view, everything is fine. If not, alas and bitter.",no,ro,"De curand am absolvit cursul Javascript from scratch din cadrul SDA.

Cursul este impartit pe module, la fiecare dintre ele putand avea un alt trainer, iar acest lucru a fost primul impediment. Din cauza schimbarii trainerilor a fost greu sa ne adaptam la modul de predare al fiecaruia. Unii dintre traineri sunt foarte prost pregatiti din punct de vedere pedagogic. Din 7-8 traineri, aproximativ 3 au fost cei de la care pot spune cu adevarat ca am invatat, la restul incercam sa acopar cat mai mult golurile lasate de ei. Materialele prezentate, cat si cele de pe platforma de invatare oferita de SDA, sunt, in mare parte, vetuste.
La final pot spune ca nu as recomanda SDA mai departe tocmai din cauza acestor lucruri. Oamenii care cauta reconversia profesionala incearca sa isi dozeze timpul cat mai bine, si din cauza neajunsurilor prezentate mai devreme, la SDA dai cu banul.

I started the Software Tester course at SDA Academy in January, aware that, since it was a professional retraining, I was starting from scratch. I expected a large volume of new information, and reality did not contradict me. That is why I dedicated myself 100% to each course session. In parallel, I invested a lot of time in individual study – I deepened the theoretical part and constantly practiced working with different tools specific to the field.

I chose the Employment Guarantee package and I can say with all conviction that it was one of the best decisions I made. Both the financial investment, as well as the time and effort put in were fully rewarded: I managed to find a job in manual testing even before completing the course.

I have only words of praise for the trainers – very well prepared, always available to provide clear explanations, regardless of whether it was about the time dedicated to the course or questions that arose during the week. A big plus, both for them and for the management team, was the quick reaction they had when I was announced “on short notice” that I was going to have a technical interview for my current job. After I informed them, they immediately mobilized, and the next morning I had a mock interview with one of the trainers – something that helped me enormously.

In conclusion, I highly recommend SDA Academy to anyone who wants a career in IT. However, you must be aware that you will be working with a large volume of new information, and success also depends on individual work. With the help of the trainers, the resources provided and a proactive attitude, I am convinced that anyone can succeed in this field.",no,ro,"Salutare,

Am inceput cursul de Software Tester in cadrul SDA Academy in luna ianuarie, constient ca, fiind vorba despre o reconversie profesionala, pornesc de la zero. Ma asteptam la un volum mare de informatii noi, iar realitatea nu m-a contrazis. Tocmai de aceea, m-am dedicat 100% fiecarei sesiuni de curs. In paralel, am investit mult timp in studiul individual – am aprofundat partea teoretica si am exersat constant lucrul cu diferite tools specifice domeniului.

Am ales pachetul Employment Guaranteesi pot spune cu toata convingerea ca a fost una dintre cele mai bune decizii pe care le-am luat. Atat investitia financiara, cat si timpul si efortul depus au fost pe deplin rasplatite: am reusit sa imi gasesc un job in testare manuala chiar inainte de finalizarea cursului.

Despre traineri am doar cuvinte de lauda – foarte bine pregatiti, mereu disponibili sa ofere explicatii clare, indiferent ca era vorba de timpul dedicat cursului sau de intrebari aparute in timpul saptamanii. Un mare plus, atat pentru ei, cat si pentru echipa de management, a fost reactia rapida pe care au avut-o atunci cand am fost anuntat „din scurt” ca urmeaza sa am un interviu tehnic pentru actualul loc de munca. Dupa ce i-am informat, s-au mobilizat imediat, iar a doua zi dimineata am avut o simulare de interviu cu unul dintre traineri – lucru care m-a ajutat enorm.

In concluzie, recomand cu toata increderea SDA Academy oricui isi doreste o cariera in IT. Trebuie, insa, sa fiti constienti ca veti lucra cu un volum mare de informatii noi, iar succesul depinde si de munca individuala. Cu ajutorul trainerilor, al resurselor oferite si cu o atitudine proactiva, sunt convins ca oricine poate reusi in acest domeniu.",ro,"2 reviews",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106545913660917289553?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvbnRtU1BREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2cd4257cfbe895ba!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMDontmSPQ%7CCgwI8-CswAYQgLOCxAM%7C?hl=en,

A lot of promotion and fake reviews for people who have no teaching experience;))… Leave the reviews and better announce that you are waiting in 2 weeks as it says in the contract, so that you can't get behind and sue them to pay you double 😆😆😆

Multa promovare și review uri false pentru niste oameni care n au experiență de predare;))…Lăsați review urile și mai bine anunțați ca așteptați peste 2 săptămâni cum scrie în contract,ca să nu poți să te lași dupa și să te dea în judecată să le plătești dublu😆😆😆",ro,"1 review",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114179954027271423056?hl=en,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VQX1M3cE9LcFp5bEFnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x2cd4257cfbe895ba!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEP_S7pOKpZylAg%7CCgwIuvXmwQYQ2O-rjwI%7C?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/ABOP9ptAT5vabgS8VMKAmFnooiYwwle3b9vX8FmaLi0A3xXfuY_HJi3Yezh1qM4HgC_fKAkRlfa17dRfnLau3iJy36VNRhwnhhAKOuqvCASC_GISObkMcipRU49G_fIPWt1NAeQ7nxPnuZ8qJ-NM

I was told that I would receive the materials at the end of January and that didn't happen. I don't know when the course starts, what time it will be, what days of the week. Totally disappointing. I don't recommend it. I regret the decision.",no,ro,"Am platit in luna decembrie integral un curs iar ei nu mai raspund pe whatsapp, la mailuri au raspuns doar o data cu scuze dar fara un raspuns clar. Mi s a spus ca primesc materialele la sfarsitul lunii ianuarie si nu s-a intamplat. Nu stiu cand incepe cursul, la ce ora va fi, in ce zile ale săptămânii. Per total dezamagitor. Nu recomand.
